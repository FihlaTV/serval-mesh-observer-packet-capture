# How to use this directory
Inside here are alternate runXXX and configuration files intended to replace
the ones that come packaged on Mesh Extenders by default for testing
purposes.

This table outlines what these files do and where they belong:

| File        | Location                  | Function                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| runlbard    | `/etc/serval/runlbard`    | Manages the LBARD daemon on boot   |
| runservald  | `/etc/serval/runservald`  | Manages the ServalD daemon on boot |
| serval.conf | `/serval-var/serval.conf` | Defines ServalD behaviour          |
