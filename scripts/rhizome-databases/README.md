# How to use this directory
Inside this directory are tarballs of Rhizome databases used for testing or ones that were
retrieved and are deemed to cause bugs.

The tarballs contain **the 'Rhizome' directory and its contents**, as stored in the '/serval-var/'
directory of a Mesh Extender or '/usr/local/var/cache/serval' of other systems. It is important
the directory is preserved to avoid littering the target directory when extracting them.
